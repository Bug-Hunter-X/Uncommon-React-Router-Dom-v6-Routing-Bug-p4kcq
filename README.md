# Uncommon React Router Dom v6 Routing Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug encountered with React Router Dom v6.  A route definition, seemingly correct, leads to unexpected rendering behavior.  The problem only surfaces under specific circumstances, making it difficult to debug.

## Problem Description
The issue involves unexpected rendering behavior from seemingly correct route definitions in React Router Dom v6.  The wrong components may render or nothing renders at all.  This is particularly noticeable when dealing with nested routes or alongside other components. The bug is not consistently reproducible and only appears under certain conditions.  This makes it challenging to diagnose through typical debugging methods.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully examining the routes' definitions and checking for potential conflicts or unintended interactions between the routes. It may require testing different configurations and simplifying the route structure to isolate the issue.
